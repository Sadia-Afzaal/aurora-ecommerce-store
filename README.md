### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

**Windows:**

```

### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment

This creates sample products, categories, users, and reviews.

### Step 7: Start the Server

python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 8: Open Your Store

Go to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**

---

## 🔐 Demo Accounts

After running `seed_data`, you can login with:

| Role | Username | Password |
|------|----------|----------|
| Admin | `admin` | `admin12345` |
| Customer | `demo` | `demo12345` |

**Admin Panel:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

---

## 🔄 Reset Demo Data

Want to start fresh?

```bash
python manage.py seed_data --flush
```

This removes all existing data and loads new sample data.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

For production, you can override settings using environment variables:

- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- `DJANGO_DEBUG`
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

Check `.env.example` for guidance.

---

## 📝 Notes

**Product Images**
- Products use remote image URLs (`Product.image_url`) to keep the repository small
- You can also upload actual image files through the admin panel
- Uploaded images take priority over URLs

**Payment**
- The checkout "payment" step is a demonstration
- No real payment gateway is connected
- Orders are placed immediately upon submission
